## This is a simple Express.js server that handles GET and POST requests. Here's a breakdown of the code:

**Lines 1-2:** The first two lines require the Express.js module and create an instance of the Express app.

**Line 3:** The PORT variable is set to 3000, which is the port number that the server will listen on.

**Line 4:** The app.use(express.json()) line tells Express to use the json() middleware, which allows the server to parse JSON data sent in the request body.

**Lines 5-14:** An array of book objects is defined, with each object having an id, item, and quantity property.

**Lines 15-17:** The first route is defined, which handles GET requests to the root URL (/). When a GET request is made to this URL, the server will:
> Log the query string (if any) to the console using console.log(request.query).
Send the entire books array as the response using response.send(books).

**Lines 18-21:** The second route is defined, which handles POST requests to the root URL (/). When a POST request is made to this URL, the server will:
> Log the request body (which should contain JSON data) to the console using console.log(request.body).
Add the new book object from the request body to the books array using books.push(request.body).
Send a response with a status code of 201 (Created) using response.send(201).

**Line 22:** The server is started, listening on port 3000. When the server is running, it will log a message to the console indicating that it's running on port 3000.

### Here's an example of how you could interact with this server using curl commands:

- GET request: curl http://localhost:3000/ would return the entire books array.

- POST request: curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id": 5, "item": "New Book", "quantity": 100}' http://localhost:3000/ would add a new book to the books array and return a 201 status code.

### Note that this is a very basic implementation and lacks error handling, validation, and security measures that a real-world application would require.
## Thank you.
